# Sales-Data-Analysis

**Project Summary**
Performed comprehensive pricing, revenue, and profit optimization analysis on a large global sales dataset (5,000+ records), uncovering actionable insights to support dynamic, seasonal, geographic, and channel-specific pricing strategies.
**Key Contributions**
Designed and implemented a full sales analytics workflow using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and tabulate to process, clean, and visualize multi-dimensional sales data.

Segmented customers and orders by Region, Country, Sales Channel, and Order Priority, enabling user-based, geographic, and value-based pricing strategies to maximize profit and reduce costs.

Conducted detailed Revenue Performance Analysis:

Broke down Total Revenue by Item Type, Region, Country, and Sales Channel to identify high-margin and high-volume products and regions.

Built monthly revenue trend line charts for each product and region, revealing clear seasonal peaks to support seasonal pricing adjustments.

Performed advanced demand and price elasticity analysis, including:

Demand curves for key product lines to understand price sensitivity.

Forecasted demand using time-series grouping to support dynamic pricing and markdown optimization.

Applied Value-Based Pricing segmentation:

Identified premium customer segments (e.g., Critical priority orders for Cosmetics in high-income regions) justifying higher pricing based on perceived value.

Optimized markdown timing for low-priority, low-volume segments.

Developed well-structured, reusable Python code using:

Clear groupby, pivot, and aggregation pipelines for modular, maintainable analysis.

Effective data visualization using Matplotlib for actionable executive reporting.

Best practices like copying DataFrames safely, clear index handling, and using tabulate for professional reporting.

Automated generation of insightful performance reports, including margin %, average unit price, revenue share, and trend analysis.

Clearly communicated insights to demonstrate how retailers can optimize margin, revenue, and cost structure using data-driven pricing models.

**Impact Statements**
Enabled a 360Â° pricing strategy covering dynamic, seasonal, geographic, and channel-specific dimensions.

Identified high-margin, low-volume customer segments for premium upselling.

Supported markdown and inventory optimization for underperforming product lines.

Delivered clear visuals and reporting for stakeholders to act on pricing insights.
